How to cultivate self hatred?
======

Do you have a dream? Ah, yes the typical human experience filled with dreams and desires as vast as the Arabian sea. It’s said, “the difference between a dream and desire is, a dream is cultivated with in and a desire is planted by an external environment”. Aye aye, is it not a fancy way to distinguish between the seeds that sprout within and those that are sown by the external world.

Since our understanding of the world is shaped by those who surround us, one might ponder: Are all dreams merely desires in disguise? It's a conundrum, my friends.

What happens, if by a twist of fate or landslide of unfortune, your desires remain unfulfilled or your dreams slip through your hands like the ICC world cup trophy by India in 2023. Brace yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, for the emotional journey that is followed by this, which I assume, you must have experienced along with 1.3 Billion people.

You, my dear reader, are an emotional animal. Your sentiments, as delicate as the petals of the rose, find themselves withered and hurt. Life takes a steep course, your sorrow, unable to find solace ignites the hell fire which leads to anger, the fire burns you until you become the ultimate enemy of yourselves.

Surprisingly enough, this emotional turmoil happens both on a grand and a miniscule scale.

On the grand scale, it unveils itself over decades. A silent discourse where desires thwarted and 
dreams unrealized. However, on microscopic level, it’s a daily drama. A routine where promises are 
made to be broken, a trip to the gym, a vow to eat healthy, a resolution to abandon people who are toxic. Alas my friends, these promises more often than not, are lost in the cyclone similar to the one that hit Chennai recently.

And what follows? A perpetuation of normalcy. "Ah, next week for sure," you tell yourself. "Next month, without a doubt." The grand declaration of "2024, for sure, macha!" becomes your shield against self-blame. You escape, my friends, running from the promises you made to yourself. In the long run, you betray the most crucial relationship - the one with yourself.    

This act of betrayal, on a daily basis, breaks your spirit, my dear reader. You see yourselves through a distorted lens of a loser, a sucker, a pauper unloved and uncared for, left to perish amongst billions like you. 

But, what if for a second, imagine you were to fulfill your commitments and resolutions, one day at a time?Ah, that, my friends, is a mystery best unravelled by each of you individually.
