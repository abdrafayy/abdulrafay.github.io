What does the cat say?  
HO HO HO  
What does the cat say?  
Purr Purr  
What does the cat say after making a joke? "Just kitten!" 😸

Hello everyone, I am Abdul Rafay, this is PurrfectDrive, where  
machine learning 👨🏻‍💻, feline charm 🐈 and automotive 🏎 passion converge.

Meet my buddy Whiskers, an ingenious marvel  
During the day, he roams around the city, wherever curiosity leads him.  
At night, he codes for me, manages this website, comes up with new ways of solving problems.
